Nodes:
	- have a type name pointer. @done(2010-07-11)
	- can be visited. @done(2010-07-11)
	- have an arity range describing how many child nodes they will accept.
	- unify leaf and branch nodes?
	- have a reference to their parent.
	Leaf nodes:
		- have a data pointer. @done(2010-07-11)
		- are nullary.
	Branch nodes:
		- have any number of child nodes. @done(2010-07-11)
		- have a definable arity range allowing fixed arity (unary, binary, ternary, etc) as well as n-arity.
		- should branch nodes specialize leaf nodes? i.e. should branch nodes have a data pointer? it seems restrictive to omit it.
