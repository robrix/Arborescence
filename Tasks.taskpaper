Nodes:
	- have a reference to their parent. @done(2010-07-14)
	- enforce arity.
	- construct nodes via a factory function taking the class. @done(2010-07-19)
	- allow mutable nodes?
	- handle data alignment/padding.
Visitors:
	- remove visitor: from the delegate visitor methods.
	- pass a context pointer around.
		Isn’t that what the visitor reference is for? Isn’t it our context pointer? If so, it should be easy to extend/subclass the visitors.
